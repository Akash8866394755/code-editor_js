I'm finally here to develop a code editor application using everything I've learned about javascript during the learning process. This code editor contains some basic features, such as the ability to produce output of HTML and CSS code, but not yet JavaScript code. Do not fear, I will construct a fully functional code editor similar to Visual Studio Code after learning everything there is to know about JavaScript. My goal is to develop low-latency web applications.
